The Core Goal

  Your primary objective was to completely remove Sanity.io from your project and transition all data management (products, categories, brands, banners) to MongoDB, with
  Cloudinary handling image storage. This is a significant architectural change.

  What We Did (Phased Approach)

   1. Updated MongoDB Models (`models/` directory):
       * Action: We compared your existing Mongoose schemas (Product.js, Category.js, Brand.js, Banner.js) with their corresponding Sanity schemas.
       * Reason: Sanity schemas often contain more fields or different structures than initial Mongoose models. To ensure MongoDB could store all the data previously managed
          by Sanity, we expanded your Mongoose models to include fields like slug, originalPrice, discount, sku, status, variant, customAttributes, couponCode, isOnDeal,
         dealPercentage, tags, imageUrl, parent, featured, badge, and discountAmount.

   2. Created/Extended API Endpoints (`pages/api/` directory):
       * Action: We created new API routes or extended existing ones to serve data directly from MongoDB.
       * Reason: Previously, your frontend components would query Sanity directly. Now, they need to fetch data from your own backend API, which in turn interacts with
         MongoDB.
       * Details:
           * pages/api/products/index.js: Handles GET (all products, featured, deal, search) and POST (create product).
           * pages/api/products/[slug].js: Handles GET (single product by slug), PUT (update product), and DELETE (delete product).
           * pages/api/categories/index.js: Handles GET (all categories) and POST (create category).
           * pages/api/categories/[slug].js: Handles GET (single category by slug), PUT (update category), and DELETE (delete category).
           * pages/api/brands/index.js: Handles GET (all brands) and POST (create brand).
           * pages/api/brands/[slug].js: Handles GET (single brand by slug), PUT (update brand), and DELETE (delete brand).
           * pages/api/banners/index.js: Handles GET (all banners, mini banners).
           * pages/api/orders/[id].js: Added DELETE method for orders.

   3. Implemented Admin Panel UI (`app/admin/` and `components/admin/` directories):
       * Action: We scaffolded the basic admin panel structure and created components for managing products, categories, and brands.
       * Reason: You requested an admin interface to perform CRUD operations on your data directly through the application.
       * Details:
           * Created app/admin/layout.tsx for a consistent admin navigation.
           * Created app/admin/page.tsx as the admin dashboard entry.
           * Created app/admin/products/page.tsx, app/admin/categories/page.tsx, and app/admin/brands/page.tsx as the main pages for each resource.
           * Developed ProductForm.tsx, ProductList.tsx, CategoryForm.tsx, CategoryList.tsx, BrandForm.tsx, and BrandList.tsx to handle form submissions and display lists.

   4. Migrated Frontend Data Fetching (`lib/api.ts` and various components):
       * Action: We created a new lib/api.ts file to centralize API calls and updated all frontend components that previously fetched data from Sanity to use these new API
         functions.
       * Reason: To completely decouple the frontend from Sanity and connect it to your new MongoDB-backed API.
       * Details: Functions like getCategories, getBanner, getMiniBanner, getFeaturedProducts, getAllBrands, getProductBySlug, searchProducts, getAllProductsDebug,
         getAllProducts, and getDealProducts were moved/re-implemented in lib/api.ts to fetch from your new /api endpoints.

   5. Integrated Cloudinary Image Uploads:
       * Action: Modified ProductForm.tsx, CategoryForm.tsx, and BrandForm.tsx to handle file uploads directly to your /api/upload endpoint, which then uses Cloudinary.
       * Reason: To allow administrators to upload images for products, categories, and brands directly through the admin panel, storing the resulting Cloudinary URLs in
         MongoDB.

   6. Removed Sanity Integration (Cleanup):
       * Action: Systematically deleted all Sanity-related files, packages, and configurations.
       * Reason: To ensure Sanity is completely removed from the project, reducing bundle size and eliminating unnecessary dependencies.
       * Details:
           * Removed the entire sanity/ directory.
           * Removed Sanity-related dependencies from package.json (e.g., @sanity/image-url, next-sanity, sanity).
           * Removed Sanity-specific scripts from package.json.
           * Deleted sanity.cli.ts, sanity.config.ts, sanity.types.ts, and schema.json.
           * Removed the cdn.sanity.io remote pattern from next.config.ts.

  Errors Encountered and Their Resolutions

  We faced several types of errors during this process, which is common for such a large refactoring:

   1. `Error: You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path ('id' !== 'slug').`
       * Cause: Next.js detected conflicting dynamic route parameters. This happened because we had both [id].js and [slug].js files in the same API route directories (e.g.,
          pages/api/products/[id].js and pages/api/products/[slug].js). Additionally, the app/admin/studio/[[...tool]]/page.tsx catch-all route was conflicting with other
         specific app/admin routes.
       * Resolution:
           * We standardized on [slug].js for products, categories, and brands, removing the redundant [id].js files.
           * We moved pages/api/upload.js into its own subdirectory (pages/api/upload/index.js) to prevent it from being interpreted as a conflicting dynamic route at the
             top level.
           * We removed the app/admin/studio directory, as it was a Sanity-specific route no longer needed.

   2. `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/sanity/image'` (and similar for `@/sanity.types`, `@/sanity/lib/client`, `@/sanity/queries`)
       * Cause: These errors appeared because various frontend components still had import statements referencing Sanity-specific modules, even after the sanity/ directory
         was removed.
       * Resolution: We systematically went through each file reported in the build errors (ProductCard.tsx, Footer.tsx, HomeCategories.tsx, ShopbyBrands.tsx,
         FavItems/page.tsx, account/cart/page.tsx, CartClientPage.tsx, ImageView.tsx, lib/orders.ts, app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts). For each, we:
           * Removed the Sanity import statements.
           * Updated the logic that used Sanity's urlFor or client.fetch to instead use direct image URLs (from Cloudinary) or calls to your new /api endpoints.
           * Adjusted TypeScript types (e.g., Category or Brand interfaces) to match the MongoDB models.

   3. `Module not found: Can't resolve 'framer-motion'`
       * Cause: The ImageView.tsx component used framer-motion for animations, but the package was not listed in package.json and therefore not installed.
       * Resolution: We installed framer-motion using npm install framer-motion.

   4. `Error: You're importing a component that needs `useState`. This React Hook only works in a Client Component. To fix, mark the file (or its parent) with the `\"use 
      client\"` directive.`
       * Cause: Next.js App Router requires components that use client-side React Hooks (like useState, useEffect) to be explicitly marked with "use client"; at the top of
         the file. Our newly created admin pages were missing this directive.
       * Resolution: We added "use client"; to the top of app/admin/products/page.tsx, app/admin/categories/page.tsx, and app/admin/brands/page.tsx.

   5. `TypeError: Failed to parse URL from undefined/api/products?isOnDeal=true`
       * Cause: This error occurred during the build process (server-side rendering/static generation). The fetch calls in lib/api.ts were using relative URLs (e.g.,
         /api/products). In a server environment, fetch requires absolute URLs. The process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL was undefined during the build.
       * Resolution:
           * We modified all fetch calls in lib/api.ts to prepend process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL to the API paths, making them absolute.
           * I instructed you to create/verify a .env.local file in your project root with NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 (or your production URL).
           * I also instructed you to clear the Next.js build cache (rm -rf .next) to ensure the new environment variable was picked up.

  Current Status

  At this point, all the compilation errors reported should be resolved, and your project should be fully migrated from Sanity.io to MongoDB and Cloudinary for data and
  image management.

  Next Steps for You

   1. Verify `.env.local`: Double-check that your .env.local file is correctly set up with NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000.
   2. Run `npm run dev`: Start your development server and thoroughly test all parts of your application, especially:
       * Product, category, brand, and banner display on the frontend.
       * Adding, editing, and deleting products, categories, and brands from the new admin panel.
       * Image uploads for products, categories, and brands.
       * Cart and wishlist functionality.
       * Stripe webhook processing (this might require local testing tools like Stripe CLI).
   3. Styling and UI/UX: The admin panel UI is functional but basic. You'll want to enhance its styling and user experience.
   4. Authentication/Authorization: Ensure your admin routes and API endpoints are properly protected so only authorized users can access them.
   5. Error Handling & Edge Cases: Implement more robust error handling and consider edge cases for all new functionalities.

  This was a complex task, and we've systematically addressed each piece. Let me know if you have any more questions or if anything unexpected comes up during your
  testing!
